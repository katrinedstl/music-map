Art project made together with Eirik Brom√∂ (idea and sounds).

# Idea
Select a color and a voice, and you are in the map. In this app you can listen to the surrounding people. When someone moves in a radius of 250 meter from you, you can hear the pitch raising as they approach. The people moving around you creates motion and music in a digital world.

You can see the map in action at https://geolocmusic.herokuapp.com/

# Run project
Clone the project and run `npm i to install all the dependencies.

Run `npm run dev` to start the dev server and open the browser at http://localhost:8000.
